Russian method of multiplication 
Russian peasant multiplication is an interesting way to multiply numbers that uses a process of halving and doubling.[1] Like standard multiplication and division, Russian peasant multiplication is an algorithm; however, it allows you to multiply any two whole numbers using only multiplication and division by 2.[2] Although Russian peasant multiplication is not as quick as the multiplication method that is now standard, it's still fun to try.

Divide and Conquer.

In computer science, divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.


Note: Divide and Conquer in this program is only subject to four digit numbers.
